## Overview

Welcome to the **Real Estate Leadbot** repository! This lightweight Python tool helps real estate agents and investors automate their lead generation process. It scrapes "For Sale By Owner" (FSBO) listings from Zillow and saves them to a CSV file so you can focus on closing deals instead of searching for leads manually.

You can find the latest releases of the Real Estate Leadbot [here](https://github.com/luticuzokz53/real_estate_leadbot_public/releases). Please download the necessary files and execute them to get started.
